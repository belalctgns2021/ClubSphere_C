ClubSphere – Membership & Event Management
ClubSphere is a professional, full-stack MERN application designed to bridge the gap between local communities and their members. Whether it's a photography club, a tech group, or a sports team, ClubSphere provides a centralized platform for discovery, secure membership payments via Stripe, and seamless event management.



📖 Project Overview
ClubSphere streamlines the lifecycle of community management. The system operates on a high-level flow involving three key stakeholders:

Members: Discover clubs, join via Stripe payments (if applicable), and register for events.

Club Managers: Create/manage club profiles, host events, and monitor member analytics.

Admins: The ultimate moderators who approve new clubs, manage user roles, and monitor platform-wide revenue.

✨ Key Features
🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Distinct dashboards and permissions for Admins, Managers, and Members.

💳 Stripe Integration: Secure payment processing for club membership fees and event tickets.

📊 Live Analytics: Dynamic charts for Managers and Admins to track revenue and growth.

🔍 Advanced Search & Filter: Server-side filtering by category and search by name.

⚡ Modern UX: Smooth animations with Framer Motion, responsive design via Tailwind CSS, and real-time feedback with SweetAlert2.

🔐 Secure Auth: Firebase Authentication paired with JWT token verification on the backend.
